# ABN Lookup Wrapper for Go

This wrapper attempts to provide a layer of abstraction from the ABN Lookup API. 

All the ABN Lookup methods have been added although some have yet to be unit tested, check the table below for unit tested methods. This wrapper also provides functions that can validate both ABN and ACN numbers. These functions are exported and are used by [SearchByABN](https://github.com/joshturge/abnlookup/blob/c0bb6920aeed213819a4bf890b7449edd94df82b/request.go#L28) and [SearchByACN](https://github.com/joshturge/abnlookup/blob/c0bb6920aeed213819a4bf890b7449edd94df82b/request.go#L36) to validate before sending a request to the ABN Lookup API.

## Usage
To use the wrapper for the ABN Lookup API, you need to register for a GUID (more info [here](https://api.gov.au/service/5b639f0f63f18432cd0e1a66/Registration)). Once registered, you can create a new client within your program.
```go
    client, err := abnlookup.NewClient("YOUR GUID")
	if err != nil {
		// Handle error...
	}
```
With the client created you can then use the search methods. Examples can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/joshturge/abnlookup/tree/master/example) directory.
